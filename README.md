# List GitHub Enterprise and GitHub Copilot users from GitHub APIs

This is a simple project using just HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript to list users from a GitHub organization, identifying who has a GitHub Enterprise license, who has a GitHub Copilot license, and the respective Cost Center for each user.

This project needs improvement and revision. GitHub provides an API to list Copilot users, but not a direct API to list all Enterprise users. I've implemented several workarounds to get this done. It's not 100% accurate, but it's very close, and ultimately, it's better than nothing. ;)

## Overview

This tool provides a comprehensive view of:
- All GitHub Enterprise users in your organization
- GitHub Copilot license assignments
- Cost Center assignments
- Active vs inactive users
- Detailed user activity and license history

## Features

- ‚úÖ **No Installation Required** - Single HTML file, runs entirely in the browser
- üîê **Secure** - Your credentials stay in your browser (localStorage)
- üìä **Comprehensive Data** - Combines data from multiple GitHub APIs
- üîÑ **Pagination Support** - Handles large organizations with 100+ users
- üìã **Detailed Reporting** - Shows license status, activity dates, and cost centers
- üêõ **Debug Logging** - Console logs help identify inactive users and data sources
- üíæ **Local Storage** - Saves your enterprise name and token for convenience

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Enterprise Account** with admin access
2. **Personal Access Token** with the following scopes:
   - `admin:enterprise` - Required for Cost Centers API
   - `read:org` - Required for organization member listings
   - `read:user` - Required for user details
   - If using SAML SSO, the token must be authorized for SSO

## How to Use

### Step 1: Get Your GitHub Token

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Cost Center Report")
4. Select scopes:
   - `admin:enterprise`
   - `read:org`
   - `read:user`
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token immediately** (you won't see it again)
7. If your organization uses SAML SSO, click "Configure SSO" and authorize the token

### Step 2: Open the HTML File

1. Download `github-list-users-en.html`
2. Open it in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)

### Step 3: Configure

1. Enter your **Enterprise Name** (e.g., `your-company-name`)
2. Enter your **GitHub Token** (starts with `ghp_`)
3. Credentials are automatically saved to localStorage

### Step 4: Generate Report

1. Click the **"üìã List Users"** button
2. Wait for the data to load (may take a few minutes for large organizations)
3. Review the results in the table

## Understanding the Report

### Summary Statistics

- **Cost Centers** - Total number of cost centers configured
- **Total Users** - All unique users found
- **Enterprise + Copilot** - Users with both licenses
- **Enterprise Only** - Users with only Enterprise license
- **Inactive/Deleted** - Users in Cost Centers but not in active organizations
- **Organizations** - Number of organizations processed

### Table Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Name** | User's display name from GitHub profile |
| **Email** | Public email from GitHub profile (if available) |
| **Username** | GitHub username/login |
| **Cost Center** | Assigned cost center name |
| **Enterprise** | ‚úì = Active member, ‚úó = Not a member |
| **Copilot** | ‚úì = Has Copilot license, ‚úó = No Copilot |
| **Created** | When Copilot license was created |
| **Cancellation** | Pending cancellation date (if any) |
| **Last Activity** | Last time Copilot was used |
| **Status** | ACTIVE or INACTIVE |

### Status Indicators

- **ACTIVE** (green) - User is an active member of an organization
- **INACTIVE** (red) - User is listed in Cost Centers but not found in any organization (possibly deleted)

## Debug Information

The tool provides detailed console logging:

### Phase 1: Cost Centers
Logs all users found in Cost Centers

### Phase 2: Organizations
- Lists all active organization members
- Lists all Copilot license holders
- Cross-references data sources

### Phase 3: User Details
- Fetches individual user profiles
- Identifies deleted/404 users
- Flags inconsistencies (e.g., Copilot without Enterprise)

### Open Browser Console
- **Chrome/Edge**: Press F12
- **Firefox**: Press F12
- **Safari**: Enable Develop menu, then press Cmd+Option+I

## Rate Limiting

- The tool includes automatic delays between API calls (200-300ms)
- Processes up to 100 items per page
- For large organizations, the report may take several minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Please enter your GitHub Enterprise name"
- Make sure you've filled in the Enterprise Name field

### Error: "Please enter your GitHub Personal Access Token"

### Error: "HTTP 401"
- Your token may be invalid or expired
- Generate a new token and try again

### Error: "HTTP 403"

- Ensure token has `admin:enterprise` scope
- If using SAML SSO, authorize the token

### Error: "HTTP 404"
- Enterprise name may be incorrect
- Cost Centers may not be configured
- You may not have access to the enterprise

### Users showing as INACTIVE
- These users exist in Cost Centers but are not active members
- They may have been removed from the organization
- Consider cleaning up Cost Centers to remove them

### Missing Copilot data
